# XSS (Cross-Site Scripting Attack)
- Attackers inject malicious scripts into web applications, which are then executed in the browser of other users.
- Example: In a vulnerable site like `abc.com`, an attacker can inject malicious code through forms, URLs, or any input field. This injected script will run on the site and allow the attacker to make unauthorized changes.

### Vulnerabilities
- **User session hijacking**: Attackers can steal user cookies, allowing them to hijack active sessions.
- **Unauthorized activities**: Attackers can perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the user (e.g., posting on a userâ€™s social media account).
- **Capturing keystrokes**: Malicious scripts can capture everything the user types, exposing sensitive information like passwords or personal data.
- **Stealing critical information**: Attackers can access and manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) to capture sensitive data.
- **Phishing attacks**: Attackers can inject forms via scripts that look legitimate, tricking users into submitting their personal information.

### Mitigation
- **List all input points**: Identify all possible input sources where users provide data and sanitize them.
- **Avoid using `innerHTML`**: Use safer alternatives like `innerText` or `textContent` to prevent execution of injected scripts.
- **Escaping user input**: Escape characters such as `<`, `>`, so that they are rendered as text and not executed as code.
- **Use frameworks like React**: React automatically escapes data, which helps prevent XSS.
- **Sanitize data**: Libraries like `DOMPurify` or built-in sanitization functions can encode/decode data and strip out malicious content.
- **CSP (Content Security Policy)**: Use CSP headers to control which scripts are allowed to execute on your site.

## Content Security Policy (CSP)
A CSP provides an extra layer of security to prevent XSS and data injection attacks by specifying which resources are trusted.

### Key Features of CSP:
- **Allowed Sources**: Specify trusted sources from which scripts, styles, images, and other resources can be loaded (e.g., only allow scripts from your domain).
- **Script Nonces**: Apply unique nonces (randomly generated values) to inline scripts. This ensures that only authorized inline scripts can execute.
- **Report-Only Mode**: Enables monitoring of potential attacks without blocking any content. If malicious content is detected, reports are sent to a specified endpoint, allowing for tracking and logging of incidents.

This overview of XSS and CSP outlines common attack vectors and mitigation techniques that developers can apply to secure web applications from script-based attacks.
