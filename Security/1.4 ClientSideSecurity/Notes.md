# Client Storage Security

## Storing Sensitive Data on Client Storage
- **Sensitive Data in Client Storage**: Storing data like session tokens in client-side storage can be risky. For example, if an attacker gains access to local storage, they could potentially retrieve session tokens and impersonate a user.
  - **Store on Server**: Sensitive data should ideally be stored on the server rather than the client. For example, instead of storing session details in `localStorage`, keep them in a secure server session that only the backend can access.
  - **Encrypt Data**: Encrypt sensitive data before storing it in client-side storage. If storing sensitive data locally is necessary (e.g., offline applications), ensure it is encrypted, making it difficult to interpret if accessed by unauthorized individuals.
  - **Token Expiry**: Set tokens to expire within a limited timeframe to mitigate risks. For instance, setting an access token to expire after 30 minutes reduces the time an attacker has if they gain access.

## Authentication
- **Token Storage Best Practices**: Secure token storage methods help protect against unauthorized access and token hijacking.
  - **Use JWT/OAuth Tokens**: JWT (JSON Web Token) and OAuth tokens are preferred because they include claims about the session and can be verified by the server. For example, after logging in, the server could generate a JWT token with the userâ€™s claims, which the client then stores.
  - **Token Expiry**: Configure tokens to expire and refresh as needed. For example, implementing a refresh token system allows an access token to expire after 15 minutes, requiring the client to use the refresh token to retrieve a new one.
  - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Adding MFA provides an extra layer of security. For instance, a login could require a password and an OTP (One-Time Password) sent via SMS or an authenticator app.

## Data Integrity
- **Checksums**: Implement checksums to confirm the integrity of data stored on the client. For example, if a file with sensitive information is downloaded, include a checksum (e.g., MD5 or SHA256 hash) to detect tampering. When the data is read, compare the stored checksum to verify that no unauthorized changes have been made.

## Storage Limitation
- **Local Storage Limitations**: Browsers typically allow 5-10 MB for `localStorage`, which is limited for data-heavy applications.
  - For example, a large dataset that exceeds the limit will result in incomplete data storage. Using the Quota API allows the application to check available space and optimize data usage.
  - **Quota API**: This API helps manage storage limits by calculating the remaining storage capacity. If a large amount of user-generated content is stored locally (e.g., forms or temporary files), the Quota API can help identify when storage is full and alert users.

### Different Storage Types and Their Limits
- **LocalStorage**: Useful for storing small amounts of persistent data like user preferences, accessible even after the browser is closed. Size limit: 5-10 MB.
- **Session Storage**: Similar to local storage but data only persists while the browser tab is open, making it ideal for temporary storage like in-progress forms.
- **IndexDB**: Ideal for large datasets and offline-first applications, with a capacity of around 50-100 MB, depending on the browser.
- **Cookie**: For lightweight, essential data, especially when used in an HTTP-only, secure mode to prevent JavaScript access. Size limit: 4-20 KB.
- **Cache**: Used by the browser to store static assets like images or CSS, with a capacity of ~100 MB depending on available device space.

## Session Management
- **Secure Cookies for Session IDs**: Use secure cookies to manage sessions and avoid storing sensitive information in client-side storage directly.
  - **Example**: Instead of storing `accessToken` directly in `localStorage`, configure cookies with properties such as `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite`:
  ```javascript
  const sessionId = "yourGeneratedSessionId12345";
  document.cookie = `sessionId=${sessionId}; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict`;
