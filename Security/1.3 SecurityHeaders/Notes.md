# Security Headers

Security headers are essential HTTP headers that enhance the security of web applications by controlling browser behavior and protecting against various attacks.

## Key Security Headers

### 1. **X-Powered-By**
- **Description**: This header reveals the technology stack or server information used by a website (e.g., `X-Powered-By: Express`).
- **Purpose**: Knowing the server type can make the application more vulnerable, as attackers may exploit known vulnerabilities associated with specific technologies.
- **Mitigation**: It is generally recommended to remove or mask this header to avoid giving unnecessary information about the server.

### 2. **Referrer-Policy**
- **Description**: Controls how much referrer information is included with requests sent to other sites. Policies include `no-referrer`, `origin`, and `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`.
- **Purpose**: To limit the amount of referrer information shared, preventing sensitive data leakage.
- **Example Usage**:
  ```http
  Referrer-Policy: no-referrer
### 3. **X-Content-Type-Options**
- **Description**: Prevents browsers from interpreting files as a different MIME type than what is specified.
- **Purpose**: Mitigates certain types of attacks, such as MIME type sniffing, by ensuring browsers respect the declared content type.
- **Example Usage**:
  ```javascript
  res.setHeader('X-Content-Type-Options', 'nosniff');

### 4. **X-XSS-Protection**
- **Description**: Enables or disables the cross-site scripting (XSS) protection feature built into certain web browsers.
- **Purpose**: Helps prevent the browser from rendering pages if it detects potential XSS attacks. Setting it to block pages with detected XSS helps mitigate these attacks.
- **Example Usage**:
  ```http
  X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block

### 5. **HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)**
- **Description**: Instructs browsers to only communicate with the site over HTTPS, regardless of whether the initial request was HTTP.
- **Purpose**: Redirects all HTTP requests to HTTPS, ensuring that all interactions occur over a secure, encrypted connection. This header is particularly useful for enforcing HTTPS across the entire site and its subdomains, reducing the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Example Usage**:
  ```http
  Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
Using HSTS helps protect users by guaranteeing that all communication remains encrypted, enhancing data security and integrity.
