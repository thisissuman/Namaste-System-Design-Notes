# WebSocket

WebSocket is a communication protocol that provides **full-duplex communication** channels over a single, long-lived TCP connection. Unlike traditional HTTP, which requires a new connection for each request/response cycle, WebSocket allows for **continuous bidirectional communication** between the client and server without the need for repeated HTTP requests.

## Key Features of WebSocket

### 1. Full Duplex Communication
- WebSocket enables **full-duplex communication**, meaning that data can be sent and received simultaneously between the client and server.
- This allows for **real-time interactions**, making it ideal for use cases where updates are frequent and must occur without delay.

### 2. Bidirectional Communication
- Unlike traditional HTTP, where the client sends a request and waits for a server response, WebSocket allows both the client and server to **send messages at any time**.
- **No new HTTP request** is required once the WebSocket connection is established, reducing overhead and latency.

### 3. Single Long-Lived TCP Connection
- Once a WebSocket connection is established, it uses a **single TCP connection** that remains open for as long as needed, supporting continuous data exchange.
- Although the initial connection handshake is performed over HTTP/HTTPS, WebSocket itself operates over TCP (Transmission Control Protocol).

### 4. Continuous Bidirectional Communication
- Once established, the WebSocket connection allows for **ongoing communication** between the client and server, making it perfect for real-time applications like live chat, gaming, or financial trading.

## WebSocket Handshake Process

To initiate a WebSocket connection, a **handshake** is performed between the client and server. This handshake starts with an HTTP request, which is then **upgraded** to a WebSocket connection. Here is a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Client to Server**: 
   - The client sends an HTTP request with an `Upgrade` header to indicate that it wants to establish a WebSocket connection.

2. **HTTP Upgrade**:
   - The server acknowledges the request and upgrades the connection from HTTP to WebSocket by responding with the `101 Switching Protocols` status code.

3. **Connection Opened**:
   - Once the handshake is complete, a **persistent connection** is established, and **bidirectional communication** can begin over this single, long-lived TCP connection.

4. **Bidirectional Communication**:
   - Both client and server can now send and receive messages at any time without having to wait for the other to finish.

5. **Connection Closed**:
   - The connection remains open until either the client or server explicitly closes it.

Client to Server: 

-> Handshake (HTTP Upgrade)
Connection Opened: <- Server responds with "101 Switching Protocols"
Bidirectional Communication: <- Messages exchanged -> -> Continuous message flow between client and server
Connection Closed: <- Either party closes the connection

## WebSocket Use Cases

WebSocket is widely used in scenarios where **real-time data exchange** is critical. Some common use cases include:

- **Analytics** (e.g., tracking user interactions or page views in real-time).
- **Financial Trading Platforms** (e.g., **Zerodha**, where real-time market data and trade updates are essential).
- **Online Gaming** (for real-time multiplayer interactions).
- **Real-Time Collaboration** (e.g., **Google Sheets**, where multiple users can work on the same document and see updates immediately).

## Key WebSocket Features

### 1. WSS (WebSocket Secure)
- Similar to how HTTPS secures HTTP, **WSS** secures WebSocket communications by encrypting the data transferred between client and server. This ensures that sensitive data is not intercepted or tampered with.

### 2. Framing
- WebSocket uses a **framing mechanism** to send data. Each message is split into frames, allowing both parties to send fragmented messages without waiting for the entire message to be sent. This enhances efficiency in data transfer.

### 3. HTTP Status Code 101 - Switching Protocols
- During the WebSocket handshake, the server responds with an HTTP status code `101`, indicating that the connection is being upgraded from HTTP to WebSocket.

## WebSocket Challenges

While WebSocket offers numerous advantages, there are also several challenges associated with its implementation:

### 1. Resource Usage
- Since WebSocket connections remain open for long periods, managing large numbers of active connections can consume significant server resources.

### 2. Connection Limits
- Servers often have limits on the number of concurrent connections they can handle. Large-scale applications using WebSockets may need to manage or distribute connections across multiple servers to avoid hitting these limits.

### 3. Sticky Sessions
- **Sticky sessions** (or session persistence) ensure that a client is always directed to the same server during a session. This is critical in a WebSocket context, as the connection must remain with the same server for the duration of the session.

### 4. Load Balancing
- Load balancing WebSocket traffic can be challenging because connections need to be maintained. Some load balancers may not natively support WebSockets, requiring additional configuration or software.

### 5. Authentication
- Authenticating users in a WebSocket session may be more complex compared to traditional HTTP. Special care must be taken to ensure secure, authenticated sessions.

### 6. Connection Drop
- WebSocket connections can be dropped unexpectedly due to network issues, firewalls, or proxies. Handling reconnections in such scenarios is an essential part of WebSocket-based applications.

### 7. Firewalls/Proxies
- Firewalls or proxies may block WebSocket connections or interfere with the handshake process, leading to failed connections. Ensuring compatibility with network infrastructure can be a challenge.

### 8. Scaling
- As WebSocket connections grow, scaling the system to handle thousands or millions of connections requires robust architecture and infrastructure.

### 9. Testing/Debugging
- Debugging WebSocket connections is more complex than HTTP, as the communication is continuous and happens over a single connection. Tools and strategies for testing WebSockets must be employed.

### 10. Backward Compatibility
- Not all browsers and networks support WebSocket, especially older systems. Ensuring backward compatibility can be a concern for some applications.

### 11. Resource Cleanup
- Proper resource cleanup is essential. WebSocket connections that are no longer active should be cleaned up to free server resources and avoid performance issues over time.
