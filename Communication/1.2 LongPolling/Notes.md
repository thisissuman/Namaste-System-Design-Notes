# Long Polling

Long polling is a technique that enables the client to maintain an open connection with the server until data is available, allowing for immediate data retrieval as soon as updates occur.

### How it Works
- The client sends a request to the server and holds the connection open.
- The server only responds once new data is available or the connection times out.
- If there’s no new data within the timeout period, the server sends a timeout response, and the client can retry.

### Characteristics
- **Single Long-Lived Connection**: The connection remains open until data is available or the connection times out.
- **Reduced Latency for Updates**: New data is sent as soon as it’s available, improving user experience.
- **Scalability Challenge**: Long-lived connections can increase server load, particularly with a high number of clients.

### Communication Flow
1. **Client** sends a request and holds the connection open.
2. **Server** responds immediately if data is available; if not, it waits until data is ready or the connection times out.

### Common Use Cases
- **Payment Confirmation**: Ensures updates are received as soon as payment is processed.
- **Order Status Updates**: Notifies clients of real-time changes, like delivery tracking.
- **Messaging Systems**: Provides immediate updates when new messages arrive.
