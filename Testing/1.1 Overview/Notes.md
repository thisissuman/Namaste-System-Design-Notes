# Testing

## Unit Testing

**Definition:** Unit testing involves testing individual components or functions in isolation to ensure they work correctly.

**Tools:** Popular unit testing tools for JavaScript include Jest, Mocha, and Jasmine.

**Example:** When testing a function that adds two numbers, a unit test would verify that the function returns the correct sum for various input values.

## Integration Testing

**Definition:** Integration testing focuses on verifying that different components or modules work together as expected when integrated.

**Tools:** Testing libraries like Cypress, Selenium, and Puppeteer can be used for this.

**Example:** Testing the interaction between a frontend form and its backend API to ensure data is submitted and processed correctly.

## Functional Testing

**Definition:** Functional testing evaluates the application features and functionality from an end user's perspective.

**Tools:** Selenium, Cypress, and Playwright are commonly used for functional testing.

**Example:** Testing a login feature to ensure that users can successfully log in with valid credentials and receive appropriate error messages with invalid credentials.

## End-to-End (E2E) Testing

**Definition:** E2E testing involves testing the entire application flow, from the user interface to the backend, to ensure all components work together seamlessly.

**Tools:** Cypress, Selenium, and Playwright.

**Example:** Testing an e-commerce application from browsing products to making a purchase and receiving an order confirmation.

## Regression Testing

**Definition:** Regression testing ensures that adding new features does not break existing functionality.

**Tools:** Automated testing tools can be used for regression testing, and CI/CD pipelines often include regression test suites.

**Example:** Running a suite of tests after a new feature is added to ensure existing features still work as expected.

## Performance Testing

**Definition:** Performance testing assesses the speed, responsiveness, and overall performance of the frontend application under different conditions.

**Tools:** Lighthouse, Google PageSpeed Insights, and WebPageTest.

**Example:** Testing the load time of a webpage under various network conditions to ensure it loads quickly for users.

## Accessibility Testing

**Definition:** Accessibility testing ensures that the application is usable by people with disabilities and complies with accessibility standards.

**Tools:** Lighthouse, Axe, and Pa11y.

**Example:** Checking that all interactive elements on a page are accessible via keyboard and that screen readers can correctly interpret the content.

## Cross-Browser Testing

**Definition:** Cross-browser testing checks the application's compatibility and functionality across different web browsers.

**Tools:** BrowserStack, CrossBrowserTesting, and Sauce Labs.

**Example:** Ensuring that a web application looks and behaves consistently on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

## Usability Testing

**Definition:** Usability testing evaluates how easily users can interact with and navigate through the application.

**Tools:** Usability testing often involves manual testing and user feedback.

**Example:** Observing users as they perform specific tasks within the application to identify any usability issues.

## Security Testing

**Definition:** Security testing identifies and addresses vulnerabilities in the application, protecting it from potential threats.

**Tools:** Tools like OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, and Snyk.

**Example:** Testing for common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

## Localization and Internationalization Testing

**Definition:** These types of testing ensure that the application works correctly in different languages and regions.

**Tools:** Manual testing is often involved in checking language translations and regional settings.

**Example:** Verifying that dates, currencies, and text are correctly displayed for different locales.

## A/B Testing

**Definition:** A/B testing, also known as split testing, is a method used to compare two versions of a webpage or app to determine which one performs better.
**Example:** Presenting two different versions of a landing page to users randomly and analyzing their responses to determine which version drives more conversions.

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

**Definition:** TDD stands for test-driven development. It is a software development methodology in which tests are written before the actual code that needs to be implemented. TDD follows a cycle of steps: write a test, make the test case pass, then refactor the code.

**Example:** Writing a test for a new feature, implementing the feature to pass the test, and then refining the code while ensuring the test still passes.
