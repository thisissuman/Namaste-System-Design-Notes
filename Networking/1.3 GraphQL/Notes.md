# GraphQL Overview

GraphQL is an API query language and runtime that allows clients to request specific data structures from a single endpoint, which helps address common limitations of RESTful APIs, like over-fetching and under-fetching of data.

## ðŸ“Œ What is GraphQL?

- **Data Retrieval Simplification**:
  - In REST, multiple endpoints are needed to fetch different resources (e.g., `/api/countries`, `/api/continents`, `/api/languages`).
  - **With GraphQL**: Only a single request is needed, where clients specify the desired data format.

- **How it Works**:
  - GraphQL processes the client's request and interacts with the data source accordingly.
  - The query specifies the exact data format, reducing unnecessary data transfer.

- **Example Query**:
  ```graphql
  query ExampleQuery {
      continents {
          code
          name
      }
      countries {
          code
          name
      }
  }


## ðŸŒŸ Benefits of GraphQL

- **Prevents Over-Fetching**: Only retrieves the specified data, reducing data payloads.
- **Avoids Under-Fetching**: Clients can request all the necessary data in a single request.
- **Mobile-Friendly Performance**: Minimizes data transfer, making it ideal for mobile applications with limited resources.
- **Efficiency & Precision**: Only the requested data is returned, optimizing response sizes.
- **Declarative Data Fetching**: Clients can declare exactly what data they need in their queries.
- **Structured & Hierarchical**: 
  - Allows for nested data requests and structured data formats.
  - **Example**:
    ```graphql
    query ExampleQuery {
        continents {
            name
            countries {
                name
                languages {
                    name
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```
- **Strongly Typed**: Enforces strict types, promoting clarity and reducing errors.
- **Introspection**: Enables querying of the schema itself to understand available types and fields.
- **Real-Time Capabilities**: Supports real-time updates via subscriptions.
- **Standard HTTP Integration**: Uses familiar HTTP headers, responses, and protocols.


## REST vs GraphQL

| Aspect              | REST                            | GraphQL                           |
|---------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Data Fetching**   | Multiple endpoints              | Single endpoint                   |
| **Request Header**  | Fixed structure + HTTP methods  | Flexible (Query/Mutation)         |
| **Over/Under Fetching** | Common issues              | Resolved                          |
| **Response Size**   | Fixed                           | Flexible                          |
| **Versioning**      | Explicit                        | Implicit with schema evolution    |
| **Schema Definition** | Not well-defined             | Explicit schema definition        |
| **Real-Time**       | Polling, WebSocket             | Subscription support              |
| **Tooling**         | Postman                         | GraphQL Playground                |
| **Caching**         | HTTP Cache                      | Fine-grained caching              |
| **Client Control**  | None                            | Client decides response           |
| **Community**       | Widely adopted                 | Rapid growth, large community     |

## ðŸ”§ GraphQL Structure & Building Blocks

### 1. Server & Client

- **Server**: Handles GraphQL requests, often with the help of libraries.
- **Client**: Consumes the GraphQL API (e.g., React can fetch data via GraphQL libraries).

### 2. Key Components

#### Schema/Types
   - **Schema**: Defines the structure of data (e.g., `Country` type includes fields like `name`, `code`, `currency`).
   - **Example Schema**:
     ```graphql
     type Country {
         code: String
         id: ID
         name: String
         currency: String
     }
     ```
   - **Types**:
     - **Scalar**: Basic types like `ID`, `String`, `Int`, `Boolean`.
     - **Custom Types**: Define custom data structures, like `Country` or `Continent`.

#### Query & Mutation
   - **Query**: For fetching data (similar to GET in REST).
   - **Mutation**: For creating/updating data (similar to POST/PUT in REST).
   - **Examples**:
     ```graphql
     type Query {
         countries: [Country]
     }
     type Mutation {
         language(id: ID): Language
     }
     ```

#### Resolver
   - Functions that handle client requests and return data from the server.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     const resolvers = {
         Query: {
             countries: (parent, args, context) => {
                 return // data for countries
             }
         }
     }
     ```
